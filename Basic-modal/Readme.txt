Basic Modal Project

This Mini Project is Based off of Maximilian Schwarzmuller's Modal Project found in his online Udemy Course
"Javascript - The Complete Guide 2020".

The project is structured to use both DOM traversals & queries for practice along with his supplied HTML
Skeleton code along with his CSS Styling.

Project Requirements:
	!- Make the "Add Movie" Button function so that it reveals a modal for entering movie info
	!- When the modal is active, change the backdrop color to focus on the modal
	!- hide the modal when a user clicks outside the modal or the cancel button
	!- When a user adds their first movie, replace the placeholder text when the page is empty with the added movie
	!- When information is typed into the modal, if the modal is exited or if a new movie is successfully added clear all the inputs
	- If a user clicks on a movie card display an are you sure you wish to delete dialog, make buttons function appropriately
